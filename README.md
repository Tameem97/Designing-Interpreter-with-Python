# Designing-Interpreter-with-Python

**Note:** This Project is based on course ["Building an Interpreter from Scratch"](https://www.udemy.com/course/essentials-of-interpretation/) by Dmitry Soshnikov in which the interpreter is implemented using **JavaScript**.
On the other hand, I have used the **Python** for implementation. 

An Interpreter designed using Python that can execute AST (similiar to lisp programming language)


## Execution
To Execute the AST from user input on terminal use the following commad,
```
$ python3 main.py
```

To Run the tests provided in directory use the -tests flag
```
$ python3 main.py -tests
```

To run a file containing ast,
```
$ python3 main.py file_name
```
